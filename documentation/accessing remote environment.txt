This is a reminder for myself about deploying the bot to production server.
It needs access to remote environment variable to know which docker container to stop.

Bash docs have this for remote scritp execution:

 When  bash  is  started  non-interactively, to run a shell
       script, for example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in
       the  environment,  expands  its value if it appears there,
       and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to  read
       and  execute.   Bash  behaves  as if the following command
       were executed:
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi
       but the value of the PATH variable is not used  to  search
       for the file name.


This needs to be set in /etc/profile of the server like this
export BASH_ENV=~/.bashenv

For whatever reason exporting ~/.bashrc here doesn't work and I don't want to figure out what's going on with that.
Sourced .bashenv in .bashrc instead
